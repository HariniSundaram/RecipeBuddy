RecipeBuddy is an all-in-one cookbook. This project aims to aid beginners chefs or those who do not have the resources to buy extensive ingredients for new recipes. 
Instead, RecipeBuddy web scrapes and displays recipes based on the ingredients consumers have on hand and cuisine preference, sorting the recipes from least to greatest number of extra ingredients needed, 
time needed to prepare the recipe, or by the rating from the respective site. Users are also able to favorite recipes they enjoy, and view all of their favorited recipes in one page. 
Users are able to create their own recipes and view all of such recipes as well. Users can also use the "Recipe Plan" aspect, which generates recipes based on their caloric goals and cuisine preference.

The project utilizes CSV Files which are included in the folder. If you delete the given CSV Files, new ones should generate upon running.
